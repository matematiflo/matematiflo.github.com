This series of 6 lectures is part of the [RTG Days](https://www.groups-and-spaces.kit.edu/115.php) between Heidelberg and Kalrsruhe. The official announcement of the lectures is available [here](https://www.groups-and-spaces.kit.edu/115_810.php).

## Vector bundles on Riemann surfaces

Vector bundles on compact Riemann surfaces are of interest for at least two reasons:

1. They arise naturally in the study of analytic differential equations.
1. They provide non-Abelian analogues of the classical Jacobian variety in complex geometry.

In these lectures, we provide an introduction to these objects, focusing on their classification and the topology of their moduli spaces.

The first three lectures will focus on the general theory of *holomorphic vector bundles on a compact Riemann surface*, while the last three will present the *gauge-theoretic approach* developed by Atiyah, Bott and Donaldson in the 1980s.
